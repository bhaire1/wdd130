    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/jayne.jpg" alt="Me in a Jayne hat">
    <h2>Brian Haire</h2>
    <h2>No Known Alias</h2>
    <p>I'm a father of two, and for now I live in unreasonably Colorado.  I met my wife on my mission in Mexico where I learned Spanish as my second language.  I enjoy videogames, watching hockey, eating very spicy food, and I work (hopefully not for long) in retail.  I hope to move to Mexico as soon as I can sustain my family with the skills learned here.  I am very motivated to leave retail behind me and get back to spending nights, weekends, and holidays with my beloved family.</p>
    <p>For any of you interested in what this hideous hat I'm wearing is, it's a hat from the popular character Jayne in the TV show called Firefly.  Like many others, that show was cancelled way to soon.  Browncoats unite!</p>
